# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science at NTNU, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

# Current Project
Master's Thesis: Anomaly Detection in Chest X-rays
- Developing deep learning models for medical image anomaly detection.

# Four selected projects:
1. [Monte Carlo Tree Search and Neural Networks](https://github.com/bjorneme/MCTS-ANET)
   - Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a neural network to iteratively improve game-playing policies through simulated training and reinforcement learning.
2. [Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders](https://github.com/bjorneme/Autoencoder)
   - Implements autoencoders and variational autoencoders for image generation and anomaly detection using MNIST data.
4. [Power Consumption Forecasting](https://github.com/bjorneme/Forecasting)
   - Develops and compares LSTMs, CNNs, and feed-forward networks to forecast 24-hour electric power consumption using historical data.
6. [Movi.com](https://github.com/Jensern1/Movi.com)
   -  Movi.com is a website built with React and TypeScript, using GraphQL for queries, TanStack Query for data fetching, and a custom backend powered by Apollo Server and a Prisma database
